## Key features and advantages

- Onboards all your teams into CNO and lets them define their projects, onboard their team members, and multi-cloud environments.

-  Allows you to deploy your applications faster by choosing the advanced deployment strategy that best suits your use case: Blue/Green, Canary, or A/B Testing

## For what and for whom?
### What uses-cases CNO covers?

Introducing Kubernetes is not easy for companies. Due to its natural complexity and youth, aligning people, hardware needs, and business goals is a real challenge.

**CNO** helps you to build the adoption program to minimize resistance and **aligns cloud-native technology with Business.**

It effectively combines three key elements: 
- The best onboarding experience for your teams; 
- A reliable and consistent continuous deployment of your applications to market;
- The security involvement during onboarding and the continuous deployment of the applications.

### Who can benefit from CNO?

**Every professional involved in delivering applications**  either in development or production environments, can benefit from CNO's actions: I.T. managers, project owners, network administrators, developers, etcetera.

You can see  **CNO**  as a  **Common Language**: from Ops to Developers to Project Managers. We believe they all should be able to efficiently collaborate in a single place.

-   If you are an Ops, DevOps, DevSecOps, or you love dancing with kubectl: You can perform your Kube-oriented actions and even more challenging things directly from the built-in command-line cnoctl.
    
Suppose you only want to work with Kubernetes in specific scenarios but don't want to bother knowing all the documentation details. In that case, you can perform pre-defined homogenous actions Kubernetes offers through the User Interface. Imagine it as a soft layer translating Kubernetes into incredible designs.
 
## Core concepts

Only four concepts, i.e., four steps, to achieve onboarding and deploying at scale

### CNO Hub

Hide the complexity of multi-cloud or multi-cluster Kubernetes infrastructure management.
CNO Hub centralizes management, governance, and monitoring of your Kubernetes clusters on any cloud from a single Console. 
May it be public or on-premise.
